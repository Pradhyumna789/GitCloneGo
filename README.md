# GitCloneGo

## Project Abstract

### This project is a from-scratch implementation of Git, the popular distributed version control system. Built as part of the Codecrafters Git challenge, it dives deep into Git’s internals — from its object model to its low-level plumbing commands.

### Throughout the project, this Git clone evolves from initializing a .git directory to fully cloning a public repository from GitHub using the raw Git protocol.

- Key Features & Learning Milestones
- Initialize a .git directory structure
- Read and write Git blob and tree objects
- Create Git commit objects
- Parse and construct Git object files in the .git/objects directory
- Perform a repository clone by reading and resolving all objects from a remote

### I'm building this project to gain a deeper understanding of Git’s internals, its object model, and the network protocols that power commands like git clone.
